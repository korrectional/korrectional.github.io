**I decided to start writing here to document my progress, as well as pass time (I often end up with a computer that isn't totally mine, so I can only interact with github)
A couple days ago, I started learning about pentesting, and the idea of breaking into stuff for money sounded cool.**

*Some backround*:
In the last 4 years since I learned how to program, I've been jumping between different areas, including gameDev, OSdev and WebDev. Yet I never got exceptionally good at any, and I
really need something concrete to brag about for schools and stuff. Many of the reasons that I gave up on things like OSdev, WebDev, Data Science, Machine Learning (not GameDev, I still
do it with a lot of passion) were that I couldn't really find cool uses for it (ohoh I made a search engine for houses in Austin, so cool) or super mega complicated (FAT12 took the remaining
cells/transistors i had in my breain). Now Pentesting has some interesting applications.
